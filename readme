*****************************************************************************************************************************
To run:
	simply run make from both server's and client's directory
	./server
	./client 127.0.0.1

FTP:
	FTP can run in two modes, active or passive. FTP uses two channels between client and server, the command channel and the
	data channel.The command channel is for commands and responses, the data channel is for actually transferring files.
	In passive mode, client establishes both channels.
	We are using Passive mode of FTP.
	->client opens up command channel from random client port to server port.(ftp-client.cpp, 265)
	->server sends the port no. of data channel on command channel.(serve.cpp, 79)
	->client opens up data channel to server on the received port no.(ftp-client.cpp, 281)
	->server sends the acknowledgement on data channel.(serve.cpp, 91)

*****************************************************************************************************************************
ftp-server.cpp
	creates the socket on defined port and starts listening on it.(code-24 to 75)
	after receiving connection it creates a child process by using fork, copies the file descriptor of command channel to stdin 
	for simplicity and runs the executable serve which handles further requests from the client.(code-77 to 98)

*****************************************************************************************************************************
serve.cpp
	it sets up the data channel and handles the further requests from the client


*****************************************************************************************************************************
ftp-client.cpp
	establishes the command channel and data channel to server.(code-263 to 308)
	reads the commands from stdin and handles them accordingly.
